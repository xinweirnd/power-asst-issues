[Typora](http://typora.io) is a minimal markdown editor, providing new ways for reading and writing markdown. It is currently in beta.

Typora is commercial software (not open source), but is free during beta. [Typora on GitHub](https://github.com/typora) supports collaboration between its developer, and its *user community*, providing a place to transparently report issues, collect feedback and discuss future direction. It also provides open source resources for user customization of themes.

# The Typora Issues Repo

The repo you are looking at is the Typora Issues Repo. It exists as a public forum to gather users' feedback and discussions on bugs, missing features or desired enhancements. For questions on how to use Typora, see [How to find support](#how-to-find-support).

While you can use email to send bug reports or suggestions, I and the Typora community prefer you use this public forum for the sake of transparency and efficiency.  

As a developer I want to make Typora perfect. I welcome all user ideas and opinions.

## How to report a bug, missing feature, or suggest an enhancement

2. If someone has, feel free to vote that issue up or add your own feedback in a comment.
